.SS INTRODUCTION
.PP
The library works by associating string variables
.RB ( "const char*" )
to allowed command line arguments.
After being set up, running
.B argeater_process
will set the associated string pointers to the values submitted
as arguments on the command line.
Thereafter, the program can consult the associated strings to
interpret the users' intentions.

An array of properly-constructed
.B AE_ITEM
items can also be used to build a usage display using functions
.BR argeater_show_usage ", " argeater_show_options ", and " argeater_show_arguments .
