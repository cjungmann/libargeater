.SS ACLONE (struct arg_clone)
.PP
.PP
This linked list element points to the command line arguments that
are passed to the program in function
.BR main.
.PP
As a linked list, the elements can be easily removed as they are
consumed, so unhandled arguments can be flagged or dealt with
when
.B argeater_process
is finished parsing the arguments.
.PP
This linked list is created with the function
.BR argeater_clone_args .
The first argument in
.B main
is the name of the running command, and we'll use this
non-argument argument as handle to the first remaining
argument as arguments are removed during parsing.
