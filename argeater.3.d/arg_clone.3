.SS ACLONE (struct arg_clone)
.PP
This linked list element points to the command line arguments that
are passed to the program in function
.BR main.
.PP
.p_ACLONE
.TP
.BI "const char * " value
This is a pointer to one of the elements of the
.I argv
argument of
.BR main.
.TP
.BI "struct arg_clone * " next
is a pointer to the next argument in the clone list.
.PP
As a linked list, the elements can be easily removed as they are
consumed, so unhandled arguments can be flagged or dealt with
when
.B argeater_process
is finished parsing the arguments.
A handle-only
.B ACLONE
item should preceed the first command argument as a pointer to access
the first of the remaining command arguments.
.PP
There are two library functions that help build the
.B ACLONE
list:
.BR argeater_clone_args " and " argeater_clone_word_list .
